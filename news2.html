        <h1>Date: 14 March 2024<br>
          Venue: Kowloon Bay
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p> My colleagues always suspected that I had a girlfriend in Japan, given my frequent trips to Japan. Twice,
          sometimes even once a month, I would leave the office on a Friday evening and head straight to the airport. By
          midnight on Monday, I would touch down in Hong Kong and head straight to work. This has been my routine for
          over 10 years now. </p>
        <p> It's not about a secret romance. It's about my deep love for Japanese culture and the need to find solace
          and relaxation. Occasionally, I find myself attending J-pop star concerts, while other times I simply go with
          the flow and relax without any particular agenda. I've only been able to stay for 2-3 days most of the time
          due to limited annual leave. </p>
        <p> When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the feeling of being trapped in Hong Kong became unbearable. I could no
          longer bear the repetitive routine. So, I decided to "naked resign" (leaving the previous jobs before securing
          a new offer) from my job and embarked on a six-month adventure in Canada and Japan. </p>
        <p> As an engineer by profession, my job provided a means of living and a sense of satisfaction. But I realized
          that there was so much more to life than just work. I have delved into various new experiences, such as
          learning French, practicing woodwork, and most recently, exploring the realm of saxophone playing. </p>
        <p> I discovered that fulfillment came not only from a successful job but also from pursuing diverse interests.
          In Hong Kong, the common belief is that work is the ultimate pursuit. It's the prevalent value ingrained in
          society. But I came to understand that there is so much more to life. I chose to prioritize my personal growth
          and exploration in diverse fields, instead of solely concentrating on my career. </p>
