        Kong's creative community</h1>

      <div class="text-white text-left">

          <p>The Arts Development Council's cuts in funding for the Hong Kong Federation of Drama Societies (HKFDS) have
            sent shockwaves through the industry, with shows being cancelled and artists expressing concerns about
            creative freedom and the limits imposed by the national security law. Wu Chun Him, a former committee member
            of the Arts Development Council, said, "The artistic ecosystem in Hong Kong appears to be aligning
            increasingly with that of mainland China, where artists operate within boundaries set by the government."
          </p>
          <p>In January, the HKFDS announced the cutting of its subsidy from the Arts Development Council and venue
            sponsorship from the Leisure and Cultural Services Department for the annual Hong Kong's largest theatre
            awards ceremony, the "Hong Kong Drama Awards." The council cited "inappropriate" arrangements during last
            year's event and warned the organizers against potential violations of the law. One of the presenters at
            last year's awards ceremony was Wong Kei-kwan, a political cartoonist known as "Zunzi." Another presenter
            was journalist Bao Choy, who was previously arrested in 2020 for making false statements while investigating
            the Yuen Long attacks during the 2019 protests. However, she was later cleared of any wrongdoing by the
            city's top court. This situation is indicative of a larger trend of political influence in Hong Kong's
            artistic landscape.</p>
          <p>The HKFDS had to self-fund this year's awards ceremony. The event took place on April 29th at a restaurant
            in Wan Chai, with the venue reduced by about 80%. Luther Fung, the Chairperson of the HKFDS, stated at the
            ceremony that the content of the awards ceremony, including the opening speech, would not be affected. He
            said, "Nothing has happened. We have prepared in a legal, reasonable, and just manner. We won't do anything
            improper." He also mentioned that they will continue to apply for funding from the Arts Development Council
            next year.</p>
          <p>The previous awards ceremony was held at the Kwai Tsing Theatre, which had a total of 899 seats. Due to the
            lack of official funding and venue support, this year's ceremony was moved to a restaurant with only about
            160 seats.</p>
          <p>Kenneth Fok, the Chairperson of the Arts Development Council, speaking to the media, said that as a
            government-funded body, the council must exercise caution in its use of public funds. He stated that the
            council constantly reviews its mechanisms with the government to ensure compliance with the law, including
            the national security law.</p>
          <p>Wu emphasized the close connection between securing funding, subsidies, and venue bookings in Hong Kong and
            the government's viewpoint on political correctness. This sends a significant message to the artistic
            community, creating a climate of self-censorship and uncertainty about the boundaries of artistic
            expression.</p>

            and is currently pursuing his artistic endeavors there.</p>
            <br>
          <p>In another blow to artistic freedom, the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts (HKAPA) unexpectedly
            canceled the performance of the renowned Italian play "Accidental Death of an Anarchist" in February, just
            two weeks prior to the scheduled performance. This play, created by Dario Fo, the recipient of the 1997
            Nobel Prize in Literature, was set to be staged in Hong Kong in 2020 and Beijing in 2024.</p>

            <br>
          <p>The reasons behind the cancellation were not publicly announced, but the school stated that it had sought
            legal advice and identified potential legal risks that warranted the need to protect the students. A student
            performer of the play expressed his shock on social media, stating, "The efforts and hard work of the past
            five months have been wasted due to a single decision." He believed that the answer to the cancellation of
            the performance was "very obvious." This event further underscores the challenges faced by artists in Hong
            Kong.</p>
          <p>The concerns among artists are not unfounded. Hong Kong artists now find themselves walking a fine line,
            unsure of where the limits are drawn, leading to self-censorship as a means of self-preservation. Wu
            commented, "There is a fear that those who seek to appease the government may inadvertently push the
            boundaries further, resulting in even greater limitations on artistic expression."</p>
          <p>"Hong Kong artists may need to familiarize themselves with the concept of 'playing the edge ball.' It
            appears that the boundaries in Hong Kong may be even more restrictive compared to those in mainland China,
            where artists have been practicing this approach for a long time. Mainland Chinese artists have acquired
            skills to navigatewithin the rules, whereas Hong Kong artists may not have had as much exposure to this
            practice." Hong Kong artists need to find the delicate balance between expressing their views and engaging
            in thoughtful discourse through their work, all while navigating political sensitivities. "Hong Kong artists
            need to find ways to create within a safe zone, even though there is no guarantee that their work will
            remain within the acceptable boundaries," Wu said.</p>
