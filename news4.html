        <p>Yesterday, a little girl and her grandmother were eaten by a wolf. Luckily, a huntsman came by and saved them
          by cutting open the wolf's stomach. The little girl, whose name was Little Red Riding Hood, returned home
          safely. They filled the wolf's stomach with stones, causing it to collapse and die.</p>
        <p>Little Red Riding Hood said, "I was so frightened. It was so dark inside the wolf." She promised herself that
          she would never stray from the path again.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Little Red Riding Hood's mother asked her to take some cake and wine to her sick grandmother. On
          her way, she met a wolf. The wolf tricked her into picking flowers for her grandmother, which distracted her
          from finding her way to grandmotherâ€™s house.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the wolf quickly went to the grandmother's house and pretended to be Little Red Riding Hood. The
          grandmother let the wolf into the house, not suspecting anything. The wolf then ate the grandmother and put on
          her clothes, pretending to be her. When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed that her grandmother
          looked strange, but she didn't suspect the wolf.</p>
        <p>Finally, the wolf revealed its true form and swallowed Little Red Riding Hood whole. Luckily, a huntsman
          heard the wolf snoring and discovered what had happened. He saved Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother
          by cutting open the sleeping wolf's stomach. When Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother came out, she was
          barely able to breathe. They filled the wolf's stomach with stones, which were so heavy that they caused him
          to collapse and die.</p>
        <p>The huntsman took off the wolf's skin, and Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother enjoyed the cake and wine.
          From that moment on, Little Red Riding Hood was careful and always informed her grandmother about any
          encounters with wolves.</p>
